# Malware_Behavioural_Based
this code detects frequent heap data entry and freezes it
A commandline program that scans all running programs and analyzes their behaviour.

WHen an abnormal behaviour is detected, user is alerted and asked for an action.

If user marked it as a normal program, it will bypass, otherwise - user marked is as virus -,
our application kills it and store its fingerprint on database, so it cannot run again
